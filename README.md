## Credits
This application includes externally acquired assets such as game icons. All credits go to their respective owners, these assets AT ANY POINT have NOT been used for commercial purposes (this is a learning project). Big fat thanks to my team mates Giada Pisani and Laura Bognanni for their awesome UI, UX and custom assets work. Thanks to Aryan Garg for his chat screen contribution.
